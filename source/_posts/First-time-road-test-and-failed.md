Today has been a rough day. The rain hasn't helped my mood, and I was hoping for a better outcome. Despite feeling confident in my driving abilities and having driven to many places, including highways, I wasn't able to pass my driving test.

I arrived at the wrong time for my appointment, thinking it was at 8:00 am but it was actually 9:00 am. This caused me to wake up early and head to the testing center. On top of that, I was unable to fall asleep the night before for some unknown reason.

When it was finally my turn for the test, I was faced with a flat tire on my car. I had to change the tire, but even after that, I had to wait for the car in front of me to finish the test before it was my turn again. Unfortunately, the tire was damaged beyond repair, with a nail having gone straight through the surface.

When I finally returned to the testing road, the officer was on lunch break. I practiced for another hour and waited an additional hour before finally taking the test, but unfortunately, I still failed.
