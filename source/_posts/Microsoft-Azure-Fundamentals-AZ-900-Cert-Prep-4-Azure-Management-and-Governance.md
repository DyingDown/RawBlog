## Management And Monitoring

### Azure Resource Manager

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the core management layer in Azure. Without it, no operation ‚Äî deployment, configuration, or monitoring ‚Äî is possible. It acts as the central controller for all resource interactions.

**Tools That Interact with ARM**

You can use various tools to interact with Azure:

- Azure Portal (GUI)
- Azure PowerShell
- Azure CLI
- SDKs / REST APIs
- Custom client apps

No matter which tool you use, all requests are routed through ARM.

**How a Resource Deployment Request Flows**

1. User sends a request through any management tool.

2. The request reaches ARM.

   ARM then:

   - Authenticates the user (using Azure Active Directory).
   - Authorizes the user (using Role-Based Access Control).
   - Validates the request (checks if all required parameters are present and valid).
   - Standardizes the request (so every request looks the same regardless of source).

3. ARM identifies the appropriate resource provider:

   - Microsoft.Compute for VMs
   - Microsoft.Network for networking
   - Microsoft.Storage for storage
   - etc.

4. ARM forwards the request to the registered resource provider.

   - ‚ÄúRegistered‚Äù is important: not all providers are available by default. Some need to be manually registered in the subscription.

5. The provider provisions the requested resource.

6. ARM generates an ARM Template (a JSON file) capturing:

   - Resource type and name
   - Subscription and resource group
   - Region
   - Configuration parameters

**ARM Templates**

- JSON-based infrastructure-as-code representations of a deployment.
- Allows for repeatable deployments.
- Useful for automation and consistency.
- You can redeploy similar resources by reusing or modifying the template.

**Azure Bicep (Advanced Option)**

- A domain-specific language (DSL) that simplifies writing infrastructure as code.
- Easier to read/write than raw ARM JSON templates.
- Compiles to ARM template JSON under the hood.

**Security & Consistency**

- All tools communicate with ARM over TLS 1.2 (secure channel).
- Prevents interception or tampering.
- Because ARM standardizes the requests, it ensures consistent behavior across all tools.

**Summary of Roles**

| Component                    | Role                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Azure Portal / CLI           | Interface layer (user interaction)                         |
| Azure Resource Manager (ARM) | Core management layer: validates, routes, and standardizes |
| Azure AD                     | Authenticates users                                        |
| RBAC                         | Authorizes users                                           |
| Resource Providers           | Actual services that provision and manage the resources    |
| ARM Templates                | Save deployment details for repeatability                  |
| Bicep                        | Higher-level IaC language over ARM templates               |

### Azure PowerShell

- A cross-platform scripting interface by Microsoft.
- Text-based console where you type commands to manage Azure.
- ‚ÄúCross-platform‚Äù = works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

**Why Use PowerShell?**

- Ideal for repetitive, consistent, and scalable tasks.
- Example: Deploying 100 virtual machines is tedious via the Portal, but quick with a script.

**Cmdlet Structure**

- PowerShell commands are called ‚Äúcmdlets‚Äù.
- They follow the Verb-Noun format:
  - Example: New-Cake (hypothetical)
    - Verb: New
    - Noun: Cake

You can customize a cmdlet using:

- Parameters (require a value)
  - e.g. -Message "Happy Birthday" (string in quotes)
  - e.g. -Flavor Chocolate (value without quotes, assuming it‚Äôs not a string)
- Switches (don‚Äôt need a value)
  - e.g. -Now

**Getting Started**

- PowerShell is built into most Windows machines.

- You can install it on Linux/macOS.

- To manage Azure, you need the Azure PowerShell module:

  ```bash
  Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force
  ```

  ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/DyingDown/img-host-repo/202505131343093.png)

  Wait a few minutes to allow it to install.

**Authentication**

- You must connect to Azure with valid credentials.

  ```bash
  Connect-AzAccount
  ```

  ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/DyingDown/img-host-repo/202505131351808.png)

- Then you can check connection

  ```bash
  Get-AzContext
  ```

  ![image-20250513135305393](C:\Users\o_oya\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\image-20250513135305393.png)

**Common Cmdlets for Azure Resource Deployment**

- `New-AzVM` ‚Üí deploy a new virtual machine
- `New-AzVirtualNetwork` ‚Üí create a virtual network
- `New-AzStorageAccount` ‚Üí set up a storage account

Combine these with the right parameters and switches to automate deployments.

### Azure CLI

Azure CLI is Microsoft‚Äôs cross-platform command-line tool for managing Azure resources. It allows you to execute tasks via text commands in various terminal environments.

**How Is It Different from PowerShell?**

- PowerShell is a full scripting language and environment.
- Azure CLI is a command-line tool (a module) that runs inside:
  - Windows Command Prompt
  - PowerShell
  - macOS Terminal
  - Bash on Linux

Both can manage Azure, but the syntax and style differ.

**Who Should Use Which?**

- Use PowerShell if you have a Windows/Microsoft admin background.
- Use CLI if you're more familiar with Linux/Unix systems.

Both tools support most of the same actions, just in different formats.

**Command Syntax**

| Tool       | Syntax Style | Example      |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| PowerShell | Verb-Noun    | New-AzVM     |
| Azure CLI  | az noun verb | az vm create |

**Fun Example**

Imagine ordering a cake:

- PowerShell: New-Cake -Message "Happy Birthday" -Flavor Chocolate -Now
- CLI: az cake create --message "Happy Birthday" --flavor chocolate --now

**Installing Azure CLI**

You must install the Azure CLI module before using it:

üîó Official install instructions: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli

Or see below for a quick guide:

**Windows**

- Download the installer from:
   https://aka.ms/installazurecliwindows

- Run the .MSI and follow the instructions. Then restart the CMD.

  ![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/DyingDown/img-host-repo/202505131753689.png)

**macOS**

Using Homebrew:

```bash
brew update && brew install azure-cli
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)**

```bash
curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
```

**Sign In to Azure via CLI**

After installation, open your terminal and run:

```bash
az login
```

It will open a browser window for authentication.

**Common Commands**

| Action                 | Azure CLI Command         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Create VM              | az vm create              |
| Create virtual network | az network vnet create    |
| Create storage account | az storage account create |

Each command supports flags like --name, --resource-group, --location, etc.

### Azure Cloud Shell

Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based command-line tool provided by Microsoft. It lets you manage your Azure resources without needing to install anything on your computer.

### Azure Arc

**Azure Arc** is a service that lets you manage **on-premises**, **multi-cloud**, and **edge** resources (like servers, VMs, databases) just like you manage native Azure resources‚Äîthrough the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, PowerShell, ARM templates, and policy.

**Why do we need Azure Arc?**

Most companies use:

- Some resources in **Azure**
- Some in **on-premises datacenters**
- Some in other clouds like **AWS or GCP**

These environments typically need separate tools for management. Azure Arc removes that barrier by bringing all these resources into Azure‚Äôs management layer.

**How Azure Arc Works (Simplified Flow):**

1. **You have an external resource**
    Example: A physical server in your datacenter or a VM in AWS.
2. **Azure Arc creates a "projection"** of that resource in Azure
    It's like a digital twin or a mirror of that external resource inside Azure.
3. **You install an agent or run a script** on the external machine
    This connects the external machine to its Azure projection.
4. **Now you can manage it like a regular Azure resource!**
    You can:
   - Apply RBAC (role-based access control)
   - Use Azure Policy
   - Monitor it with Azure Monitor
   - Enable Defender for Cloud
   - Tag and organize it
5. **Heartbeat mechanism**
    The resource sends a heartbeat every 5 minutes to Azure.
   - If no heartbeat = status becomes "Disconnected"
   - If heartbeat resumes = "Connected"

**What kinds of resources can Azure Arc manage?**

- Physical or virtual servers (Windows/Linux)
- SQL Server instances
- Kubernetes clusters (AKS, on-prem, or even GKE/EKS)
- Azure Stack HCI
- VMware vSphere environments

### Azure Monitor

**Azure Monitor** is a full-featured monitoring platform that lets you track the health, performance, and availability of:

- Azure resources
- On-premises systems
- Multi-cloud resources (e.g., AWS, GCP)

**What Can Azure Monitor Track?**

- Virtual Machines (VMs)
- Operating Systems
- Containers (e.g., in AKS, Kubernetes)
- Networking events
- Databases (e.g., SQL, Cosmos DB)
- ‚ÄØSecurity-related events
- Custom applications and events

**Key Features of Azure Monitor**

**1. Log Collection & Storage**

- Azure Monitor collects and stores **metrics and logs**.
- By default, logs are stored in **Azure Monitor Logs**.
- You can route logs to a **Log Analytics Workspace** for deeper analysis.

**2. Analysis Tools**

- **Log Analytics**: Query log data using Kusto Query Language (KQL).
- **Metrics Explorer**: Visualize metrics as charts to spot trends/spikes.

**3. Visualization Options**

- Azure Monitor integrates with:
  - **Workbooks** (interactive dashboards)
  - **Azure Dashboards**
  - **Power BI**
  - Or any external visualization tool (since logs can be exported)

**4. Alerting and Automation**

- You can define **Alert Rules** based on thresholds or conditions.
  - E.g., CPU > 90% for 10 minutes.
- Alerts can:
  - Send emails, SMS, push notifications
  - Trigger an **automated action**, like restarting a VM or scaling a service

**Specialized Insights (Built-in Views)**

Azure Monitor provides specific dashboards for:

- **Application Insights** (for app telemetry & performance)
- **VM Insights**
- **Container Insights**
- **Network Insights**

These save time‚Äîyou don‚Äôt need to build dashboards or alerts from scratch.

### Azure Advisor

**Azure Advisor** is your personalized, built-in cloud consultant in Azure.
 It analyzes your deployed services and usage patterns and gives you practical, actionable recommendations to:

- Improve performance
- Strengthen security
- Increase reliability
- Achieve operational excellence
- Reduce costs

Think of it as a smart helper that constantly reviews your environment and nudges you toward best practices.

**The 5 Key Areas of Recommendations**

1. Security: Helps you detect threats, fix misconfigurations, and align with industry standards.

2. Reliability: Ensures business continuity and application availability. Example: use of NAT gateway for stable outbound connectivity.

3. Performance: Improves app responsiveness and reduces latency. Suggests configuration tweaks or resource upgrades.

4. Operational Excellence: Guides you toward smoother workflows and best practices in deployment and management.

5. Cost: Helps you optimize cloud spend. Detects underutilized resources, suggests right-sizing, and other ways to save money.

**How Does It Work?**

- Advisor regularly scans your environment.
- It presents a list of **recommendations**, each with:
  - A **category** (e.g., cost, security)
  - A **description** and potential **impact**
  - Recommended **actions**
  - Links to implement the fix directly or learn more

You can:

- Apply recommendations directly
- Postpone them
- Dismiss them (if not applicable)

**Azure Advisor Score**

- A numerical score (e.g., 81%) gives a quick idea of how well you're following best practices.
- The score increases as you implement more recommendations.
- Smaller environments may show fewer suggestions, but as your cloud usage grows, more insights appear.

### Azure Mobile App

2. Search for‚ÄØ‚ÄúAzure‚Äù.
3. Download and install the **Azure app**.
4. Log in with your Microsoft credentials.

### Azure Service Health

**Azure Service Health** helps you stay informed about issues that may impact your Azure services‚Äîbut from Microsoft's side (the platform), not yours. It complements other monitoring tools by giving visibility into the‚ÄØ**health of the Azure cloud itself**, rather than just your environment.

**Shared Responsibility Model**

- **Your responsibility**: Your resources and configurations.
- **Microsoft‚Äôs responsibility**: The availability and health of Azure services.

Azure Service Health focuses on Microsoft‚Äôs side and tells you when issues originate from Azure itself.

**Key Components**

1. **Azure Status Page (Public)**

- URL: https://status.azure.com
- Covers all Azure regions and services globally.
- Publicly available (no login required).
- Shows:
  - Current and historical issues
  - Root cause analysis (RCA)
  - Uptime transparency

2. **Service Health (in Azure Portal)**

- Personalized: Shows only the services and regions your tenant uses.
- Includes:
  - Active incidents
  - Planned maintenance
  - Health advisories
  - Security advisories

**Key Features in the Portal**

**Health Alerts**

- Get notified automatically when Azure services you rely on experience issues.
- Alert customization:
  - Pick specific services (e.g., Azure Active Directory)
  - Select target regions (e.g., South India)
  - Choose types of events (incidents, maintenance, advisories)

**Example Alert Setup Steps**

1. Go to‚ÄØ**Service Health**‚ÄØin the Azure Portal.
2. Click‚ÄØ**Create Service Health Alert**.
3. Select:
   - Scope (subscription)
   - Services (e.g., Azure AD)
   - Region (e.g., South India)
   - Event types (e.g., incidents, advisories)
4. Define action group (e.g., email or webhook for notifications).
5. Review and create.

**Benefits**

- Get real-time updates on Azure platform issues that affect you.
- Avoid wasting time diagnosing problems that aren‚Äôt your fault.
- Quickly identify impacted resources without manual checks.
- Maintain transparency and trust through clear communication from Microsoft.

## Governance and Compliance

### Resource Locks

Azure Resource Locks are governance tools used to prevent accidental or unauthorized changes or deletions of resources within an Azure environment.

**Key Features**

- **Purpose**:
  - Prevent unintended changes or deletions.
  - Protect against malicious modifications.
- **Types of Locks**:
  - **Read-only**: Prevents all modifications; resource is accessible but not changeable.
  - **Delete**: Allows modifications but prevents deletion.
- **Scope of Application**:
  - Can be applied at:
    - Subscription level (affects all resources under it)
    - Resource group level (affects all resources within the group)
    - Individual resource level
  - Inheritance applies: locks cascade down from higher scopes.

**Difference from RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**

| Resource Locks                         | RBAC                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Applied to resources                   | Applied to users/groups                 |
| Prevents actions like delete/modify    | Controls what actions users can perform |
| Overrides all roles (even admin users) | Permissions depend on assigned roles    |

**Important Notes**

- Locks work through Azure Resource Manager (ARM), which blocks unauthorized operations.
- Locks do not affect runtime behavior of apps:
  - E.g., a VM with a lock can still be used by an app to read/write to its disk.
  - But you can‚Äôt delete or change the VM settings until the lock is removed.

**How to Apply a Lock**

1. Navigate to the Azure resource (e.g., a VM).
2. In the left menu, go to‚ÄØ**Locks**.
3. Click‚ÄØ**Add**.
4. Provide:
   - Lock name (e.g.,‚ÄØAZ 900 Lock 1)
   - Lock type (e.g.,‚ÄØDelete)
   - Optional notes for context
5. Save. The lock is now active.

Attempting to delete the resource after locking will result in an error

### Resource Tags

Resource Tags in Azure are‚ÄØ**Name:Value pairs**‚ÄØused to add metadata to your resources for the purpose of organization, management, cost tracking, and visibility.

Think of them like sticky labels on storage boxes‚Äîhelpful for sorting, finding, and categorizing.

**Key Characteristics**

- **Format**:
  - Each tag consists of a Name and a Value (e.g., `environment: testing`).
- **Scope**:
  - Can be applied at the:
    - Subscription level
    - Resource group level
    - Individual resource level
- **Flexible Usage**:
  - There‚Äôs no fixed set of tags; you define them based on your needs.

**Common Tag Use Cases**

| Tag Name    | Example Value   | Purpose                           |
| ----------- | --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| environment | testing, prod   | Identify resource environments    |
| department  | IT, HR, Sales   | Group resources by internal teams |
| application | app1, app2      | Relate resources to specific apps |
| owner       | user@domain.com | Identify responsible person       |

You can apply multiple tags to a single resource.

**Why Use Tags?**

- **Organization**: Easily group and find related resources.
- **Cost Management**: Break down billing by tags (e.g., total cost of "app1" resources).
- **Visibility**: View or filter by specific tags in the Azure Portal.
- **Automation**: Tags can be used in scripts or policies to automate resource governance.

**Tagging Best Practices**

- Tags are stored in plain text (not encrypted).
- **Do not store confidential info** (e.g., passwords or keys) in tags.
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across your organization for easy filtering and standardization.

**How to Add a Tag (Demo Summary)**

1. Go to the Azure resource (e.g., VM: az 900 vm1).
2. Click on‚ÄØ**‚ÄúClick here to add tags‚Äù**.
3. Add a tag (e.g., `environment: az900 demolab`).
4. (Optionally) Add more tags.
5. Click **Save**.

Once saved, clicking on a tag shows all other resources with that same tag‚Äîmaking it easy to manage groupings like demo labs or test environments.

### Azure Policy

**Azure Policy** is a governance tool in Azure that helps **enforce organizational standards and compliance** rules automatically ‚Äî **before** or **after** resources are created.

Why Use It?

Without policy:
 Users can freely create any resource, with any name, size, region, or config ‚Äî this gets messy fast in large orgs.

With Azure Policy:
 You can control and streamline how resources are created, improving **security**, **cost management**, **performance**, and **standardization**.

**What Can Azure Policy Do?**

Here are examples of what you can enforce:

- **Naming conventions**
   e.g., force all production resources to start with `prod-`.
- **Allowed VM sizes**
   Only allow sizes between 4 vCPUs/8GB and 16 vCPUs/32GB RAM.
- **Storage type**
   Enforce premium storage only for performance-sensitive workloads.
- **Use of service endpoints**
   Block public IPs in VNets for better security.
- **Allowed or disallowed regions**
   Ensure resources are only deployed in approved Azure regions.
- **Mandatory tags**
   Enforce that all resources include tags like `environment`, `owner`, or `costCenter`.
- **Resource locks**
   Automatically apply locks on critical resources to prevent accidental deletion or modification.

**Scope of Application**

You can apply policies at different levels:

- üîπ Management Group (highest)
- üîπ Subscription
- üîπ Resource Group
- üîπ Individual Resource (lowest)

Policies inherit **top-down**, but you can **exclude specific child scopes** if needed.

**How Is It Defined?**

- Azure Policy is written in **JSON** format.
- You can use built-in policies, modify them, or write custom ones.

```json
{
  "properties": {
    "displayName": "Require a tag on resources",
    "policyType": "BuiltIn",
    "mode": "All",
    "description": "This policy ensures that all resources have the tag 'environment'.",
    "parameters": {
      "tagName": {
        "type": "String",
        "metadata": {
          "displayName": "Tag Name",
          "description": "Name of the tag to enforce"
        },
        "defaultValue": "environment"
      }
    },
    "policyRule": {
      "if": {
        "field": "[concat('tags[', parameters('tagName'), ']')]",
        "exists": "false"
      },
      "then": {
        "effect": "deny"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Remediation**

If you apply a new policy and some existing resources don't comply, you can run a **remediation task** to bring them into compliance (e.g., adding missing tags, changing SKU types).

### Azure Blueprint

Azure Blueprint is a way to package everything that defines your Azure environment ‚Äî including infrastructure, policies, access control ‚Äî so you can recreate that same environment in a consistent, repeatable way across subscriptions.

**What does an Azure Blueprint include** (i.e., its ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù)?

1. ARM Templates ‚Äì Infrastructure-as-code definitions for the resources you want to deploy.
2. Resource Groups ‚Äì Logical containers to organize and place your resources.
3. Role Assignments ‚Äì Who has access to what, based on RBAC.
4. Azure Policy Assignments ‚Äì Governance rules that should apply to the environment.

**Why use Blueprints?**

- Reuse: Create a known-good configuration once and reuse it across teams or environments.
- Standardization: Enforce organizational standards from the beginning.
- Speed: Deploy complex environments to new subscriptions quickly and consistently.
- Compliance: Ensure things like tagging, region restrictions, and VM sizes are enforced right from deployment.

**Blueprint Lifecycle**

1. Draft ‚Äì You define the blueprint and add artifacts.
2. Publish ‚Äì Once finalized, publish the blueprint (you must do this before using it).
3. Assign ‚Äì Apply the published blueprint to a subscription.
4. Parameters ‚Äì Can be defined inside the blueprint or provided at assignment time (like region, resource name prefixes, etc.).

**Global Reach**

Blueprints are stored globally, so you can apply them across regions and subscriptions ‚Äî ensuring consistency even in multi-region environments.

### Azure Purview

Azure Purview is a comprehensive data governance solution designed to help organizations manage their data across various environments, including on-premises, cloud, and hybrid setups. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

**What Does Azure Purview Do?**

- **Data Governance**: Helps organizations manage, protect, and classify data across multiple environments (Azure, AWS, GCP, on-premises).
- **Data Map**: Purview creates a centralized data map that identifies where sensitive data is located across different platforms and applications.
- **Compliance & Security**: Ensures compliance by applying sensitivity labels to data and monitoring its usage and access.
- **Risk Management**: Purview helps in identifying risks and creating a secure environment for data access and consumption.
- **Data Lineage**: Tracks how data flows through systems, providing visibility into its origin, movement, and transformation.

## Cost Management

### Cost Factors

 1. **Type of Resource and Its Usage**

- You‚Äôre only charged for resources that **perform compute, networking, or storage functions**.
- Resources like **subscriptions, management groups, and resource groups** are free because they define structure but don‚Äôt consume compute power.

2. **Compute Resources**

Cost factors include:

- **Size** of the resource (e.g., small vs. large VM).
- **Operating System** (Windows typically costs more than Linux).
- **Runtime environment** (e.g., .NET, Java).
- **Number of instances** (for containers, functions).
- **Transactions or executions** (especially for functions and app services).

3. **Networking Resources**

Costs vary based on:

- **Ingress** (data coming into Azure) ‚Äì usually free.
- **Egress** (data going out) ‚Äì charged based on destination:
  - Same region (cheaper or free),
  - Cross-region,
  - Outside Azure (most expensive).
- **DNS** usage is billed based on the number of name resolution queries.

4. **Storage Resources**

Key pricing elements include:

### Pricing Calculator

The **Azure Pricing Calculator** is a powerful tool that helps you estimate the monthly cost of running services and resources in Azure. It allows you to configure different resources, such as virtual machines, networking, storage, and more, and gives you a price estimate based on the selected configurations. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how it works:

**Key Features:**

1. **Customization**:
   - You can specify the type of services and resources (compute, networking, storage, etc.) you want to deploy in your Azure subscription.
   - For each resource, you can select its configuration (e.g., size of a virtual machine, region of deployment, operating system, etc.).
2. **Savings Options**:
   - **Savings Plan**: You can commit to a fixed hourly amount for a term of 1 or 3 years, unlocking discounts (up to 32%).
   - **Reserved Instances**: You can reserve resources for 1 or 3 years and pay in advance, unlocking larger discounts (up to 57%).
   - **Hybrid Benefit**: If you already have on-premises licenses (like Windows Server or SQL Server), you can use them to reduce costs for Azure resources.
3. **Support Plan**:
   - The tool allows you to add a technical support plan (basic is free, but you can upgrade to more comprehensive options).
4. **Estimates and Sharing**:
   - Once you've entered all your resources and parameters, the calculator provides an estimated monthly cost.
   - You can save the estimate for later, export it for business records, or share it with teams (finance, executive, etc.) for review.
5. **Example Scenarios and FAQs**:
   - The calculator also includes example scenarios and frequently asked questions, helping you better understand the pricing structure and how to use the tool effectively.

**How It Works:**

1. **Select Resources**: You start by selecting the resources (e.g., Virtual Machines) you want to estimate the cost for. The calculator allows you to add multiple resources.
2. **Customize Configuration**: Once the resource is added (like a VM), you can select things like:
   - **Region**: Where the service will be deployed.
   - **Operating System**: Windows or Linux.
   - **Instance Size**: The number of CPUs, memory, and storage required.
3. **Apply Savings**: You can choose savings plans, reserved instances, and hybrid benefits to get discounts.
4. **View Estimate**: The tool then shows you the cost estimate based on your configurations, and you can adjust the plan if needed.
5. **Export/Save**: Once you're happy with your estimates, you can save them to your Azure account or export them for later use.

**Example Walkthrough:**

- **Virtual Machine Estimate**:
  - Suppose you select a Windows VM with 2 CPUs, 8 GB of RAM, and 50 GB of storage.
  - You can then adjust the instance size to something larger like a DS14-8 VM with 8 CPUs, 112 GB RAM, and 225 GB of storage.
  - The tool shows you the estimated price (\$1,643). You can then apply a **1-year savings plan**, which reduces the cost to \$1,495, or use a **3-year reserved instance** to lower it further to ‚Äã\$1,095.
- **Cheaper VMs**: If you opt for smaller VMs, like one with 1 CPU and 1 GB of RAM, the estimate may drop to as low as \$7 per month.

The **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator** is another tool designed by Azure to help organizations assess the financial implications of running workloads in the cloud versus on-premises. It differs from the **Pricing Calculator** in that it takes into account **tangential costs**‚Äîthe additional costs associated with running infrastructure on-premises.

**Key Features of the TCO Calculator:**

1. **Comparison Between On-Premises and Cloud Costs**:
   - The primary purpose of the TCO calculator is to compare the cost of running workloads **on-premises** vs. **in Azure**.
   - This helps you understand whether migrating to the cloud will be more economical over time.
2. **Tangential Costs**:
   - The calculator includes **indirect costs** that organizations often overlook, such as:
     - **Hardware**: The cost of purchasing and maintaining servers and other infrastructure.
     - **Electricity and Cooling**: The energy costs to power and cool your on-premises equipment.
     - **Physical Security**: The cost of securing the physical premises.
     - **IT Staff**: The cost of IT personnel needed to manage and maintain on-prem infrastructure.
3. **Easy Input**:
   - You don‚Äôt need to list every cost individually. You simply need to provide information about your on-premises **workloads** and their configurations (e.g., virtual machines, storage, databases).
   - Based on this data, the TCO calculator **automatically estimates** your on-premises costs.
4. **Adjustable Values**:
   - If the default cost estimates seem incorrect, you can adjust them with actual figures and set the **currency** you prefer for the calculation.
5. **Five-Year Cost Comparison**:
   - Once all the data is entered, the TCO calculator shows a **side-by-side comparison** of your on-premises vs. Azure costs over the next **five years**.
   - This comparison helps you decide whether moving to Azure is financially advantageous or if maintaining on-prem infrastructure is still more cost-effective.
6. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Often, organizations may find a **hybrid approach** (a mix of on-prem and cloud solutions) to be the most economical. The TCO calculator helps in making this decision by showing the costs for both options.
7. **Export and Save**:
   - Like the pricing calculator, you can **save** and **export** the TCO estimate for future reference or to share with other stakeholders, such as the finance team or executives.

**Why It's Useful:**

- **Informed Decision-Making**: The TCO calculator provides an in-depth view of the total costs involved in running workloads in the cloud versus on-premises, helping you make a more informed decision about your cloud migration.
- **Cost Optimization**: By factoring in all the additional costs of maintaining on-premises infrastructure, the TCO calculator can help you identify areas where you can save money by moving to the cloud.

**Example:**

If your organization is considering migrating a web application to Azure, the TCO calculator would take into account the **cost of servers** you need to run the app, the **electricity costs** for powering these servers, the **cooling requirements** to keep the servers running efficiently, and the **physical security** required to protect the infrastructure. It would then compare these total costs with the cost of running the same workloads on Azure.

### Cloud Pricing Model

In Azure, there are different **cloud pricing models** for **Virtual Machines (VMs)**, each designed to optimize costs based on your usage needs. Here are the three primary models:

1. **Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)**

- **Description**: This is the **default pricing model** for Azure. You pay for the resources (VMs, storage, etc.) you use, **without any upfront commitment**.
- **How it works**: You can spin up a VM and delete it anytime. You're billed at the **retail price** for the time the VM is running.
- **Ideal for**:
  - Short-term projects.
  - Flexible usage where you don't need long-term commitments.
  - On-demand resources where uptime and performance requirements are not as critical.

2. **Reserved Instances**

- **Description**: With **Reserved Instances (RIs)**, you make a **1- or 3-year commitment** to use a specific VM configuration and pay **upfront** for the term.
- **Discount**: In exchange for this upfront commitment, you get a **discount** on the regular pay-as-you-go price. The longer the commitment, the higher the discount.
- **How it works**: You lock in resources (e.g., VM size, region, operating system) for the term, and Azure will reserve that capacity for you.
- **Ideal for**:
  - Long-term, predictable workloads.
  - Applications that need consistent compute capacity over a long period (e.g., production servers).
  - Users who want to save money on VMs by making an upfront commitment.

3. **Spot Instances**

- **Description**: **Spot Instances** allow you to take advantage of **unused Azure compute capacity** that is being auctioned at a significantly reduced price.
- **How it works**:
  - Spot Instances are only available when **Azure has extra unused capacity**.
  - Azure can **reclaim the capacity** at any time, meaning your workloads may be **interrupted** and your VMs can be stopped without notice.
- **Ideal for**:
  - **Low-priority workloads** that can tolerate interruptions (e.g., testing, batch processing, or research).
  - Applications where it doesn't matter if the VM is shut down unexpectedly.
  - Cost-sensitive users who can take advantage of lower prices but can work around the potential disruptions.

4. **Hybrid Benefit (for existing on-premises licenses)**

- **Description**: If you already have **on-premises licenses** for Windows Server or SQL Server, you can **reuse those licenses** in Azure for **a discount** on virtual machine resources.
- **How it works**: You **don‚Äôt need to purchase new licenses** for Azure. You can apply your existing licenses to reduce the overall cost of running workloads on Azure.
- **Ideal for**:
  - Organizations with existing software licenses who want to migrate workloads to the cloud without buying new licenses.
  - Businesses that want to reduce their **Azure licensing costs** by leveraging their **existing investments** in on-premises software.

### Cost Management and Billing

**Key Features of Cost Management and Billing:**

1. **Cost Insights**
   - This tool provides detailed **cost insights** into your Azure resources, allowing you to analyze your **spending trends** over time.
   - It helps you understand **where your money is going**, which services or resources are consuming the most budget, and which regions or resource groups are incurring the highest costs.
2. **Cost Analysis**
   - You can view detailed **cost breakdowns** by parameters like services, resource groups, resources, tags, and more.
   - It helps you track your current and forecasted spending, breaking it down by day and estimating monthly totals.
   - You can also change the **currency** to match your preferred unit for reporting.
3. **Setting Up Alerts and Budgets**
   - One of the most powerful features is the ability to set up **spending alerts**. You can define thresholds, so you're notified when your costs approach or exceed a set limit.
   - **Budgets** can be created to **track** your expenses against a target and help prevent overspending.
4. **Advisor Recommendations**
   - **Azure Advisor** provides recommendations on how to **optimize costs**, such as downsizing resources, shutting down unused services, or adjusting configurations to save money.
   - This feature helps to ensure that you're not overprovisioning and that you're using resources efficiently.
5. **Manage Billing Settings**
   - You can modify **payment settings**, add or change credit cards, configure **wire transfers**, and view **past invoices**.
   - Additionally, you can **transfer billing ownership** between accounts, set up email notifications for invoices, and manage subscription status.
6. **Delegating Billing Management**
   - It's a best practice to **delegate the task of cost management** to a dedicated **billing administrator**, ideally someone in the finance department.
   - By doing so, you can ensure that cost monitoring is handled by someone who understands **cloud costs** while you focus on more critical tasks related to your business operations.

**Cost Management and Billing in Action:**

- Once you're in the **Azure portal**, you can navigate to **Cost Management and Billing**.
- On the **overview page**, you'll find links to tools and resources that will help you analyze and optimize costs.
- The **Cost Analysis** tool displays **daily spending graphs** and forecasts your expenses for the rest of the month. You can see a breakdown by **resource type**, **region**, and **resource group**, making it easy to pinpoint where the most significant expenses are occurring.
- You can also **create alerts** for certain spending thresholds, helping prevent unexpected cost overruns.

**Use Case:**

In practice, you might notice that certain resource groups or regions are consuming more budget than expected. For example, if you're using **South US region** the most, you might find that resources deployed there are causing higher-than-expected costs. This could prompt you to either optimize the resources, switch to another region, or adjust configurations to save costs.

**Best Practices:**

- **Delegate billing** to someone from the finance department who can manage costs and understand the financial impact of cloud services.
- **Use cost alerts** and **budgets** to monitor spending and avoid surprises.
- **Leverage Advisor recommendations** to ensure your resources are optimized for cost-efficiency.
