## Expand canvas

1. Unlock the layer (if there is little lock besides the layer)
2. Crop tool, choose ratio
3. press Alt and drag the frame (Alt make it spread from center)

## Fill the rest

1. Ctrl + click the first layer
2. Ctrl + Shift + i (Select the opposite)
3. Select->Modify->Expand (for me: choose 5 pixels)
4. Edit->Content-Aware Fill
