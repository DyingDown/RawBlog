I’ve been preparing to learn Machine Learning for a few days, but always being delayed by some stuffs like building my blog. After beautifying the blog for a long time, I pick up my course today. Today’s course is about the introduction of Machine Learning.

There are two definitions of Machine Learning.

## Arthur Samuel

>  The field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.”

 This is an older, informal definition.

## Tom Mitchell

>  A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.

Eg: playing checkers

E = the experience of playing many games of checkers

T = the task of playing checkers.

P = the probability that the program will win the next game.

This is a more modern definition.
