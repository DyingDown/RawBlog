To describe supervised learning,we establish notation for future use.

**$x^i$ **denote the **input** variables also called input features

**$y^i$ ** denote the **output** variables also called target variables that we are trying to predict.

A pair **($x^i, y^i$) **is called a training set.

<!--more-->

**Note**: **i** is just a superscript implying an index to the training set, and has nothing to do with exponentiation.

**X** denote the space of input values.

**Y** denote the space of output values.

If the target variables are continuous, we call the learning problem a regression problem.

If Y can take on only a small number of discrete values, we call the learning problem a regression problem.
