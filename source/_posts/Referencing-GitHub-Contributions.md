There is an API that helps you do it quickly. [https://ghchart.rshah.org/](https://qq52o.me/go/aHR0cHM6Ly9naGNoYXJ0LnJzaGFoLm9yZy8=)

Repository [https://github.com/2016rshah/githubchart-api](https://qq52o.me/go/aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tLzIwMTZyc2hhaC9naXRodWJjaGFydC1hcGk=)

## Usage

```html
<img src="https://ghchart.rshah.org/your-GitHub-Username">
```

This helps you get a image.

Also you can define color yourself, it will automatically span into a range of colors.

```html
<img src="https://ghchart.rshah.org/409ba5/your-GitHub-Username">
```

Just add a color hexadecimal before the user name.
